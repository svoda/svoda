🌟 Key Projects   
Project Name 1: Chicago Public Schools (CPS)    

Description: This project provides valuable insights into the factors influencing college enrollment rates among students from Chicago Public Schools (CPS). By identifying key predictors such as student attendance, teacher attendance, misconduct rates, and graduation rates, the analysis highlights which school-related metrics are most strongly correlated with college enrollment outcomes. The goal is to build a predictive model that can assist policymakers and educators in understanding and improving college enrollment strategies for CPS students.     
🧑‍💻 Tech Used:     
- Languages: R (dplyr, ggplot2, caret, randomForest)
- Libraries/Packages: dplyr, ggplot2, caret, randomForest, VIF, 
- Environment: RStudio
- Techniques: Linear Regression, Random Forest, Correlation Analysis, Data Visualization

Project Name 2: Wisconsin Breast Cancer Diagnosis Analysis     

Description: This project focuses on the development and evaluation of a machine learning pipeline to classify breast cancer tumors as benign or malignant. Using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset, the analysis applies LASSO for feature selection and several classifiers—K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, and Random Forest—to optimize the model's predictive accuracy. The aim is to demonstrate the potential of machine learning in improving early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer.

🎉 Beyond Work
When I’m not crunching numbers or building models, I enjoy drawing, painting, and crafting. I’m also passionate about reading books and volunteering in the trucking industry, where I assist in the accounting department.
